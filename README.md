# Time-tracker

This time tracker is a progressive web application that works offline. It's deployed to https://time-tracker-9000.web.app/
The purpose of the app is to track how much time is spent on different tasks.
I implemented it as a test project while I was reading Angular tutorial https://angular.io/tutorial. 
Instead of creating the useless Heroes app I decided to implement this time tracker.

## Todo:

### nearest:
- add grouping by days
- add total time for today
- auto-save
- search
- tags
- favorites
- sessions (show details about that the task was started and stopped several times)
- create about page and show it on the first page load
- change app icons
- replace localStorage with indexedDB
- export to csv
- settings page with compact view
- add option to select several items and show total time

### questionable:
- idle task
- bigger buttons for mobile
- speech to text/voice commands
